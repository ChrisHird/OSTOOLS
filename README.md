# OSTOOLS
A collection of sample 'C' code *PGMs and *SRVPGMs which can be used as a basis for further development. The aim is to show how to develop modular 'C' programs for the IBM i 
by using the ILE language capabilities provided by the system. The concepts can be used to develop applications using any ILE capable language such as RPG by adding additional 
modules and service programs to the ones provided.
# Samples
